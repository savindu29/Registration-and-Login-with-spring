# Registration-and-Login-with-spring

 Welcome to the Secure User Authentication and Registration Backend project, powered by Spring Boot! This project focuses on creating a robust and secure backend application to manage user registration and authentication processes. Leveraging the power of Spring Boot, we've developed a feature-rich backend that includes email verification links to ensure data integrity and user security.

## Key Features:

### 1.  User Registration: 
* Users can easily register for your application, providing essential information like username, email, and password.

### 2. Email Verification: 
* To enhance security, an email verification system is in place. After registration, users receive a verification link via email to activate their accounts.

### 3. Password Encryption: 
* User passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database to protect sensitive information.

### 4. Authentication: 
* Registered users can log in securely using their credentials, providing a seamless and safe login experience.

### 5. Session Management: 
* User sessions are managed efficiently to ensure a smooth and secure user experience during their session.

### 6. Error Handling: 
* Robust error handling ensures that the application gracefully handles exceptions and provides informative responses.

### 7. Database Integration: 
* We utilize a database system to store user information securely, with options to easily configure your preferred database.
